# Final-project
blackhole simulator
purpose:
- make a blackhole with pygame/Unity engine if possible(Unity is a recommendation from the professor but it's time consuming as its the first time I use it(their natural languages are C# which is a complex version of java which I haven't started yet.))
- The simulation had to be a graphics simulation
- uses real physics
- object input affects the blackhole

natural language: Python
engine: pygame/ Unity Engine(natural language: C#)/Unreal Engine(C++)
what's in there:
 - gif background/natural jpeg/a black screen
 - white multiple dots in straight lines in the forward direction. It curves as a blackhole is born.
 - human image, animal, etc. It's a JPEG image (there will be an object input, like a multiple choice); if not possible, the user has to input a word
 - planet simulation with real physics if I had even more time(so as a blackhole gets closer to a planet/collides with it, what will happen)
    - If possible/ if there is more time, I would give an effect for planets(possibly a funny one, or maybe no one would laugh).
